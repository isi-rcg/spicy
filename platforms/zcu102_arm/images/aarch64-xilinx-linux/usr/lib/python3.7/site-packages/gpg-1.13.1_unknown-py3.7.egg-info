Description: Dynamically generated bindings to the C API of the GNU Privacy Guard.
        
        The GPG Made Easy (GPGME) library provides a high-level API in C to all the
        component software and libraries in the GnuPG Project, including GPG itself
        (the GnuPG OpenPGP implementation), libgcrypt, libgpg-error, libassuan and
        more.
        
        The official CPython bindings to GPGME are generated during the compiling
        process of GPGME itself and built for the specific C header and include files
        produced when GPGME is compiled using SWIG.  This provides access to over two
        thousand functions, methods and values via both the lower level dynamically
        generated bindings and a more intuitively pythonic higher level layer.
        
        While the lower level, dynamically generated bindings provide access to
        everything which GPGME itself provides; the higher level layer is easier to use
        by Python developers, provides access to the vast majority of functionality
        developers would want from GnuPG and is extensively documented.
