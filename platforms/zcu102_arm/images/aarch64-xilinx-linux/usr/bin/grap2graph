# grap2graph -- compile graph description descriptions to bitmap images
#
# by Eric S. Raymond <esr@thyrsus.com>, May 2003
#
# In Unixland, the magic is in knowing what to string together...
#
# Take grap description on stdin, emit cropped bitmap on stdout.
# The grap markup should *not* be wrapped in .G1/.G2, this script will do that.
# A -U option on the command line enables gpic/groff "unsafe" mode.
# A -format FOO option changes the image output format to any format
# supported by convert(1).  All other options are passed to convert(1).
# The default format is PNG.
#

# Requires the groff suite and the ImageMagick tools.  Both are open source.
# This code is released to the public domain.
#
# Here are the assumptions behind the option processing:
#
# 1. None of the options of grap(1) are relevant.
#
# 2. Only the -U option of groff(1) is relevant.
#
# 3. Many options of convert(1) are potentially relevant, (especially 
# -density, -interlace, -transparency, -border, and -comment).
#
# Thus, we pass -U to groff(1), and everything else to convert(1).
