		This operation suspends the kernel and powers off the processor.  All
		peripherals not used as a result of this operation will be powered
		down or put into retention mode.  (Note that peripherals that are still
		being used by the RPU, such as memory, will not be powered down.)

		If no peripherals on the FPD are being used as a result of this operation,
		the FPD will be powered off.

		While the processor is suspended, all the data and context information is
		stored in the DRAM.  If the FPD is powered off, the DRAM will be put into
		self-refresh mode.
