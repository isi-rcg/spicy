 * a single media device. Those functions are exposed through separate USB
 * interfaces and handled through unrelated kernel drivers, they must thus be
 * manually added to the same media device.
 *
 * This function adds a new entity to the given media device and initializes it
 * from the given entity description and device node name. Only the following
 * fields of the description are copied over to the new entity:
 *
 * - type
 * - flags (MEDIA_ENT_FL_DEFAULT only)
