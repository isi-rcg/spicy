/*
 *  This file contains a very simple set of routines which might
 *  be shared by preprocessors.  It allows a preprocessor to indicate
 *  when an inline image should be created.
 *  This string is intercepted by pre-grohtml and substituted for
 *  the image name and suppression escapes.
 *
 *  pre-html runs troff twice, once with -Thtml (or -Txhtml) and once
 *  with -Tps.  'troff -Thtml' (and 'troff -Txhtml') emits a
 *  <src='image'.png> tag and the postscript device driver works out
 *  the min/max limits of the graphic region.  These region limits are
 *  read by pre-html and an image is generated via
 *
 *    troff -Tps -> gs -> png
