/**
 * strbuf's are meant to be used with all the usual C string and memory
 * APIs. Given that the length of the buffer is known, it's often better to
 * use the mem* functions than a str* one (memchr vs. strchr e.g.).
 * Though, one has to be careful about the fact that str* functions often
 * stop on NULs and that strbufs may have embedded NULs.
 *
 * A strbuf is NUL terminated for convenience, but no function in the
 * strbuf API actually relies on the string being free of NULs.
 *
 * strbufs have some invariants that are very important to keep in mind:
 *
 *  - The `buf` member is never NULL, so it can be used in any usual C
 *    string operations safely. strbuf's _have_ to be initialized either by
 *    `strbuf_init()` or by `= STRBUF_INIT` before the invariants, though.
 *
 *    Do *not* assume anything on what `buf` really is (e.g. if it is
 *    allocated memory or not), use `strbuf_detach()` to unwrap a memory
 *    buffer from its strbuf shell in a safe way. That is the sole supported
 *    way. This will give you a malloced buffer that you can later `free()`.
 *
 *    However, it is totally safe to modify anything in the string pointed by
 *    the `buf` member, between the indices `0` and `len-1` (inclusive).
 *
 *  - The `buf` member is a byte array that has at least `len + 1` bytes
 *    allocated. The extra byte is used to store a `'\0'`, allowing the
 *    `buf` member to be a valid C-string. Every strbuf function ensure this
 *    invariant is preserved.
 *
 *    NOTE: It is OK to "play" with the buffer directly if you work it this
 *    way:
 *
 *        strbuf_grow(sb, SOME_SIZE); <1>
 *        strbuf_setlen(sb, sb->len + SOME_OTHER_SIZE);
 *
 *    <1> Here, the memory array starting at `sb->buf`, and of length
 *    `strbuf_avail(sb)` is all yours, and you can be sure that
 *    `strbuf_avail(sb)` is at least `SOME_SIZE`.
 *
 *    NOTE: `SOME_OTHER_SIZE` must be smaller or equal to `strbuf_avail(sb)`.
 *
 *    Doing so is safe, though if it has to be done in many places, adding the
 *    missing API to the strbuf module is the way to go.
 *
 *    WARNING: Do _not_ assume that the area that is yours is of size `alloc
 *    - 1` even if it's true in the current implementation. Alloc is somehow a
 *    "private" member that should not be messed with. Use `strbuf_avail()`
 *    instead.
