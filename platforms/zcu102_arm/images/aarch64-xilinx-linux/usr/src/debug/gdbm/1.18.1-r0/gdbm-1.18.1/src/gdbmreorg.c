/* Reorganize the database.  This requires creating a new file and inserting
   all the elements in the old file DBF into the new file.  The new file
   is then renamed to the same name as the old file and DBF is updated to
   contain all the correct information about the new file.  If an error
   is detected, the return value is negative.  The value zero is returned
   after a successful reorganization. */
