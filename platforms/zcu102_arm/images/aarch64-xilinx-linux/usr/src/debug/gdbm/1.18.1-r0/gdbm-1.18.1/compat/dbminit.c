   FILE.dir.  To make gdbm compatable with dbm using the dbminit call,
   the same file names are used.  Specifically, dbminit will use the file
   name FILE.pag in its call to gdbm open.  If the file (FILE.pag) has a
   size of zero bytes, a file initialization procedure is performed,
   setting up the initial structure in the file.  Any error detected will
