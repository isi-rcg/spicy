/* For historical reasons, crypt and crypt_r are not expected ever
   to return 0, and for internal implementation reasons (see
   call_crypt_fn, in crypt.c), it is simpler if the individual
   algorithms' crypt and gensalt functions return nothing.

   This function generates a "failure token" in the output buffer,
   which is guaranteed not to be equal to any valid password hash or
   setting string, nor to the setting(+hash) string that was passed
   in; thus, a subsequent blind attempt to authenticate someone by
   comparing the output to a previously recorded hash string will
   fail, even if that string is itself one of these "failure tokens".

   We always call this function on the output buffer as the first
   step.  If the individual algorithm's crypt or gensalt function
   succeeds, it overwrites the failure token with real output;
   otherwise the token is left intact, and the API functions that
   _can_ return 0 on error notice it.  */
