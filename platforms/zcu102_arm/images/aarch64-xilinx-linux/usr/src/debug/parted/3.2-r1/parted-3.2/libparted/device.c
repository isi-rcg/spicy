 *
 * When ped_device_probe_all() is called, libparted attempts to detect all
 * devices.  It constructs a list which can be accessed with
 * ped_device_get_next().
 *
 * If you want to use a device that isn't on the list, use
 * ped_device_get().  Also, there may be OS-specific constructors, for creating
 * devices from file descriptors, stores, etc.  For example,
 * ped_device_new_from_store().
