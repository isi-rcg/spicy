/* WindowsCE uses a very strange way of handling the standard streams.
   There is a function SetStdioPath to associate a standard stream
   with a file or a device but what we really want is to use pipes as
   standard streams.  Despite that we implement pipes using a device,
   we would have some limitations on the number of open pipes due to
   the 3 character limit of device file name.  Thus we don't take this
   path.  Another option would be to install a file system driver with
   support for pipes; this would allow us to get rid of the device
   name length limitation.  However, with GnuPG we can get away be
   redefining the standard streams and passing the handles to be used
   on the command line.  This has also the advantage that it makes
   creating a process much easier and does not require the
   SetStdioPath set and restore game.  The caller needs to pass the
   rendezvous ids using up to three options:

     -&S0=<rvid> -&S1=<rvid> -&S2=<rvid>

   They are all optional but they must be the first arguments on the
   command line.  Parsing stops as soon as an invalid option is found.
   These rendezvous ids are then used to finish the pipe creation.*/
