#ifndef GNUPG_COMMON_IOBUF_H

/* An iobuf is basically a filter in a pipeline.

   Consider the following command, which consists of three filters
   that are chained together:

     $ cat file | base64 --decode | gunzip

   The first filter reads the file from the file system and sends that
   data to the second filter.  The second filter decodes
   base64-encoded data and sends the data to the third and last
   filter.  The last filter decompresses the data and the result is
   displayed on the terminal.  The iobuf system works in the same way
   where each iobuf is a filter and the individual iobufs can be
   chained together.

   There are number of predefined filters.  iobuf_open(), for
   instance, creates a filter that reads from a specified file.  And,
   iobuf_temp_with_content() creates a filter that returns some
   specified contents.  There are also filters for writing content.
   iobuf_openrw opens a file for writing.  iobuf_temp creates a filter
   that writes data to a fixed-sized buffer.

   To chain filters together, you use the iobuf_push_filter()
   function.  The filters are chained together using the chain field
   in the iobuf_t.

   A pipeline can only be used for reading (IOBUF_INPUT) or for
   writing (IOBUF_OUTPUT / IOBUF_OUTPUT_TEMP).  When reading, data
   flows from the last filter towards the first.  That is, the user
   calls iobuf_read(), the module reads from the first filter, which
   gets its input from the second filter, etc.  When writing, data
   flows from the first filter towards the last.  In this case, when
   the user calls iobuf_write(), the data is written to the first
   filter, which writes the transformed data to the second filter,
   etc.

   An iobuf_t contains some state about the filter.  For instance, it
   indicates if the filter has already returned EOF (filter_eof) and
   the next filter in the pipeline, if any (chain).  It also contains
   a function pointer, filter.  This is a generic function.  It is
   called when input is needed or output is available.  In this case
   it is passed a pointer to some filter-specific persistent state
   (filter_ov), the actual operation, the next filter in the chain, if
   any, and a buffer that either contains the contents to write, if
   the pipeline is setup to write data, or is the place to store data,
   if the pipeline is setup to read data.


   Unlike a Unix pipeline, an IOBUF pipeline can return EOF multiple
   times.  This is similar to the following:

     { cat file1; cat file2; } | grep foo

   However, instead of grep seeing a single stream, grep would see
   each byte stream followed by an EOF marker.  (When a filter returns
   EOF, the EOF is returned to the user exactly once and then the
   filter is removed from the pipeline.)  */

   Note: you may only maintain a reference to an iobuf_t as a

   setting a pointer in OV to point to the filter's iobuf_t.  This is
   because when we add a new filter to a pipeline, we memcpy the state
   in A into new buffer.  This has the advantage that there is no need
   to update any references to the pipeline when a filter is added or
   removed, but it also means that a filter's state moves around in
   memory.

   The behavior of the filter function is determined by the value of
   the control parameter:

     IOBUFCTRL_INIT: Called this value just before the filter is
       linked into the pipeline. This can be used to initialize
       internal data structures.

     IOBUFCTRL_FREE: Called with this value just before the filter is
       removed from the pipeline.  Normally used to release internal
       data structures, close a file handle, etc.

     IOBUFCTRL_UNDERFLOW: Called with this value to fill the passed
       buffer with more data. *LEN is the size of the buffer.  Before
       returning, it should be set to the number of bytes which were
       written into the buffer.  The function must return 0 to
       indicate success, -1 on EOF and a GPG_ERR_xxxxx code for any
       error.

       Note: this function may both return data and indicate an error
       or EOF.  In this case, it simply writes the data to BUF, sets
       *LEN and returns the appropriate return code.  The implication
       is that if an error occurs and no data has yet been written, it
       is essential that *LEN be set to 0!

     IOBUFCTRL_FLUSH: Called with this value to write out any
       collected data.  *LEN is the number of bytes in BUF that need
       to be written out.  Returns 0 on success and a GPG_ERR_* code
       otherwise.  *LEN must be set to the number of bytes that were
       written out.

     IOBUFCTRL_CANCEL: Called with this value when iobuf_cancel() is
       called on the pipeline.

     IOBUFCTRL_DESC: Called with this value to get a human-readable
       description of the filter.  *LEN is the size of the buffer.
       The description is filled into BUF, NUL-terminated.  Always
       returns 0.
