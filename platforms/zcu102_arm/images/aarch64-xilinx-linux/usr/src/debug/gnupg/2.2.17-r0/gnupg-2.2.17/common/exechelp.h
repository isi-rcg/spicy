/* Fork and exec the program PGMNAME.

   If R_INFP is NULL connect stdin of the new process to /dev/null; if
   it is not NULL store the address of a pointer to a new estream
   there. If R_OUTFP is NULL connect stdout of the new process to
   /dev/null; if it is not NULL store the address of a pointer to a
   new estream there.  If R_ERRFP is NULL connect stderr of the new
   process to /dev/null; if it is not NULL store the address of a
   pointer to a new estream there.  On success the pid of the new
   process is stored at PID.  On error -1 is stored at PID and if
   R_OUTFP or R_ERRFP are not NULL, NULL is stored there.

   The arguments for the process are expected in the NULL terminated
   array ARGV.  The program name itself should not be included there.
   If PREEXEC is not NULL, the given function will be called right
   before the exec.

   IF EXCEPT is not NULL, it is expected to be an ordered list of file
   descriptors, terminated by an entry with the value (-1).  These
   file descriptors won't be closed before spawning a new program.

   Returns 0 on success or an error code.  Calling gnupg_wait_process
   and gnupg_release_process is required if the function succeeded.

   FLAGS is a bit vector:

   GNUPG_SPAWN_NONBLOCK
          If set the two output streams are created in non-blocking
          mode and the input stream is switched to non-blocking mode.
          This is merely a convenience feature because the caller
          could do the same with gpgrt_set_nonblock.  Does not yet
          work for Windows.

   GNUPG_SPAWN_DETACHED
          If set the process will be started as a background process.
          This flag is only useful under W32 (but not W32CE) systems,
          so that no new console is created and pops up a console
          window when starting the server.  Does not work on W32CE.

   GNUPG_SPAWN_RUN_ASFW
          On W32 (but not on W32CE) run AllowSetForegroundWindow for
          the child.  Note that due to unknown problems this actually
          allows SetForegroundWindow for all children of this process.
