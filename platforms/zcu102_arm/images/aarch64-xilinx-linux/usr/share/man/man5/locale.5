.TH LOCALE 5 2019-03-06 "Linux" "Linux User Manual"
.SH NAME
locale \- describes a locale definition file
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B locale
definition file contains all the information that the
.BR localedef (1)
command needs to convert it into the binary locale database.
.PP
The definition files consist of sections which each describe a
locale category in detail.
See
.BR locale (7)
for additional details for these categories.
.SS Syntax
The locale definition file starts with a header that may consist
of the following keywords:
.TP
.I escape_char
is followed by a character that should be used as the
escape-character for the rest of the file to mark characters that
should be interpreted in a special way.
It defaults to the backslash (\e).
.TP
.I comment_char
is followed by a character that will be used as the
comment-character for the rest of the file.
It defaults to the number sign (#).
.PP
The locale definition has one part for each locale category.
Each part can be copied from another existing locale or
can be defined from scratch.
If the category should be copied,
the only valid keyword in the definition is
.I copy
followed by the name of the locale in double quotes which should be
copied.
The exceptions for this rule are
.B LC_COLLATE
and
.B LC_CTYPE
where a
.I copy
statement can be followed by locale-specific rules and selected overrides.
.PP
When defining a locale or a category from scratch, an existing system-
provided locale definition file should be used as a reference to follow
common glibc conventions.
.SS Locale category sections
The following category sections are defined by POSIX:
.IP * 3
.B LC_CTYPE
.IP *
.B LC_COLLATE
.IP *
.B LC_MESSAGES
.IP *
.B LC_MONETARY
.IP *
.B LC_NUMERIC
.IP *
.B LC_TIME
.PP
In addition, since version 2.2,
the GNU C library supports the following nonstandard categories:
.IP * 3
.B LC_ADDRESS
.IP *
.B LC_IDENTIFICATION
.IP *
.B LC_MEASUREMENT
.IP *
.B LC_NAME
.IP *
.B LC_PAPER
.IP *
.B LC_TELEPHONE
.PP
See
.BR locale (7)
for a more detailed description of each category.

counted and displayed for each era in the locale.
Each string has the following format:
.RS

.PP
The fields are to be defined as follows:
.PP
.TP 4
.I direction
Either
.B +
or

have lower numbers than years closer to
.IR end_date .
.B \-
means the opposite.

.I start_date
in the era, corresponding to the
.I %Ey
descriptor (see
.BR strptime (3)).
.TP
.I start_date
The start of the era in the form of
.IR yyyy/mm/dd .
Years prior AD 1 are represented as negative numbers.
.TP
.I end_date
The end of the era in the form of
.IR yyyy/mm/dd ,
or one of the two special values of
.B \-*
or
.BR +* .
.B \-*
means the ending date is the beginning of time.
.B +*
means the ending date is the end of time.
.TP
.I era_name
The name of the era corresponding to the
.I %EC
descriptor (see
.BR strptime (3)).

corresponding to the
.I %EX
descriptor (see
.BR strptime (3)).
.TP
.I era_d_t_fmt
followed by the format of the date and time in alternative era notation,
corresponding to the
.I %Ec
descriptor (see
.BR strptime (3)).
.TP
.I alt_digits
followed by the alternative digits used for date and time in the locale.
.TP
.I week
followed by a list of three values separated by semicolons:
The number of days in a week (by default 7),
a date of beginning of the week (by default corresponds to Sunday),
and the minimal length of the first week in year (by default 4).
Regarding the start of the week,
.B 19971130
shall be used for Sunday and
.B 19971201
shall be used for Monday.
See NOTES.
.TP
.IR first_weekday " (since glibc 2.2)"
followed by the number of the first day from the
.I day
list to be shown in calendar applications.
The default value of
.B 1
corresponds to either Sunday or Monday depending
on the value of the second
.I week
list item.
See NOTES.
.TP
.IR first_workday " (since glibc 2.2)"
followed by the number of the first working day from the
.I day
list.
The default value is
.BR 2 .
See NOTES.
.TP
.I cal_direction
followed by a number value that indicates the direction for the
display of calendar dates, as follows:
.RS
.TP 4
.B 1
Left-right from top.
.TP
.B 2
Top-down from left.
.TP
.B 3
Right-left from top.
.RE
.TP
.I date_fmt
followed by the appropriate date representation for
.BR date (1)
(for syntax, see
.BR strftime (3)).
.PP
The
.B LC_TIME
definition ends with the string
.IR "END LC_TIME" .
.SH FILES
.TP
.I /usr/lib/locale/locale-archive
Usual default locale archive location.
.TP
.I /usr/share/i18n/locales

POSIX.2.
.SH NOTES
The collective GNU C library community wisdom regarding
.IR abday ,
.IR day ,
.IR week ,
.IR first_weekday ,
and
.I first_workday
states at
https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/Locales
the following:
.IP * 3
The value of the second
.I week
list item specifies the base of the
.I abday
and
.I day
lists.
.IP *
.I first_weekday
specifies the offset of the first day-of-week in the
.I abday
and
.I day
lists.
.IP *
For compatibility reasons, all glibc locales should set the value of the
second
.I week
list item to
.B 19971130
(Sunday) and base the
.I abday
and
.I day
lists appropriately, and set
.I first_weekday
and
.I first_workday
to
.B 1
or
.BR 2 ,
depending on whether the week and work week actually starts on Sunday or
Monday for the locale.
