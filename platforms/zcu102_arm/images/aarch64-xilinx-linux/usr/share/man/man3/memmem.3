.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR memmem ()
function finds the start of the first occurrence
of the substring
.IR needle

.SH CONFORMING TO
This function is not specified in POSIX.1,
but is present on a number of other systems.
.SH BUGS
.\" This function was broken in Linux libraries up to and including libc 5.0.9;
.\" there the
.\" .IR needle
.\" and
.\" .I haystack
.\" arguments were interchanged,
.\" and a pointer to the end of the first occurrence of
.\" .I needle
.\" was returned.
.\"
.\" Both old and new libc's have the bug that if
.\" .I needle
.\" is empty,
.\" .I haystack\-1
.\" (instead of
.\" .IR haystack )
.\" is returned.
In glibc 2.0, if
.I needle
is empty,
.BR memmem ()
returns a pointer to the last byte of
.IR haystack .
This is fixed in glibc 2.1.
