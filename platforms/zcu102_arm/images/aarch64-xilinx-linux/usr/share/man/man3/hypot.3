.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions return
.RI sqrt( x * x + y * y ).
This is the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle
with sides of length
.I x
and
.IR y ,
or the distance of the point
.RI ( x , y )
from the origin.
.PP
The calculation is performed without undue overflow or underflow
during the intermediate steps of the calculation.
.\" e.g., hypot(DBL_MIN, DBL_MIN) does the right thing, as does, say
.\" hypot(DBL_MAX/2.0, DBL_MAX/2.0).
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, these functions return the length of a right-angled triangle
with sides of length
.I x
and
.IR y .
.PP
If
.I x
or
.I y
is an infinity,
positive infinity is returned.
.PP
If
.I x
or
.I y
is a NaN,
and the other argument is not an infinity,
a NaN is returned.
.PP
If the result overflows,
a range error occurs,
and the functions return
.BR HUGE_VAL ,
.BR HUGE_VALF ,
or
.BR HUGE_VALL ,
respectively.
.PP
If both arguments are subnormal, and the result is subnormal,
.\" Actually, could the result not be subnormal if both arguments
.\" are subnormal?  I think not -- mtk, Jul 2008
a range error occurs,
and the correct result is returned.
.SH ERRORS
See
.BR math_error (7)
for information on how to determine whether an error has occurred
when calling these functions.
.PP
The following errors can occur:
.TP
Range error: result overflow
.I errno
is set to
.BR ERANGE .
An overflow floating-point exception
.RB ( FE_OVERFLOW )
is raised.
.TP
Range error: result underflow
.\" .I errno
.\" is set to
.\" .BR ERANGE .
An underflow floating-point exception
.RB ( FE_UNDERFLOW )
is raised.
.IP
These functions do not set
.IR errno
for this case.
.\" FIXME . Is it intentional that these functions do not set errno?
.\" They do set errno for the overflow case.
.\" Bug raised: http://sources.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6795
