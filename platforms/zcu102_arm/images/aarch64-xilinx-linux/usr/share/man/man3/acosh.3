.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions calculate the inverse hyperbolic cosine of
.IR x ;
that is the value whose hyperbolic cosine is
.IR x .
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, these functions return the inverse hyperbolic cosine of
.IR x .
.PP
If
.I x
is a NaN, a NaN is returned.
.PP
If
.I x
is +1, +0 is returned.
.PP
If
.I x
is positive infinity, positive infinity is returned.
.PP
If
.I x
is less than 1,
a domain error occurs,
and the functions return a NaN.
.SH ERRORS
See
.BR math_error (7)
for information on how to determine whether an error has occurred
when calling these functions.
.PP
The following errors can occur:
.TP
Domain error: \fIx\fP is less than 1
.I errno
is set to
.BR EDOM .
An invalid floating-point exception
.RB ( FE_INVALID )
is raised.
