.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions return the tangent of
.IR x ,
where
.I x
is
given in radians.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, these functions return the tangent of
.IR x .
.PP
If
.I x
is a NaN, a NaN is returned.
.PP
If
.I x
is positive infinity or negative infinity,
a domain error occurs,
and a NaN is returned.
.PP
If the correct result would overflow,
a range error occurs,
and the functions return
.BR HUGE_VAL ,
.BR HUGE_VALF ,
or
.BR HUGE_VALL ,
respectively, with the mathematically correct sign.
.\" I think overflow can't occur, because the closest floating-point
.\" representation of pi/2 is still not close enough to pi/2 to
.\" produce a large enough value to overflow.
.\" Testing certainly seems to bear this out.  -- mtk, Jul 08
.\"
.\" POSIX.1 allows an optional underflow error;
.\" glibc 2.8 doesn't do this
.\" POSIX.1 an optional range error for subnormal x;
.\" glibc 2.8 doesn't do this
.SH ERRORS
See
.BR math_error (7)
for information on how to determine whether an error has occurred
when calling these functions.
.PP
The following errors can occur:
.TP
Domain error: \fIx\fP is an infinity
.I errno
is set to
.B EDOM
(but see BUGS).
An invalid floating-point exception
.RB ( FE_INVALID )
is raised.
.TP
Range error: result overflow
.\" Unable to test this case, since the best approximation of
.\" pi/2 in double precision only yields a tan() value of 1.633e16.
.\" .I errno
.\" is set to
.\" .BR ERANGE .
An overflow floating-point exception
.RB ( FE_OVERFLOW )
is raised.

.SH CONFORMING TO
C99, POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008.
.PP
The variant returning
.I double
also conforms to
SVr4, 4.3BSD, C89.
.SH BUGS
Before version 2.10, the glibc implementation did not set
.\" http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6782
.I errno
to
.B EDOM
when a domain error occurred.
