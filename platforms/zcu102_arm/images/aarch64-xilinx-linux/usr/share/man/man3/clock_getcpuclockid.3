.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR clock_getcpuclockid ()
function obtains the ID of the CPU-time clock of the process whose ID is
.IR pid ,
and returns it in the location pointed to by
.IR clock_id .
If
.I pid
is zero, then the clock ID of the CPU-time clock
of the calling process is returned.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success,
.BR clock_getcpuclockid ()
returns 0;
on error, it returns one of the positive error numbers listed in ERRORS.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B ENOSYS
The kernel does not support obtaining the per-process
CPU-time clock of another process, and
.I pid
does not specify the calling process.
.TP
.B EPERM
The caller does not have permission to access
the CPU-time clock of the process specified by
.IR pid .
(Specified in POSIX.1-2001;
does not occur on Linux unless the kernel does not support
obtaining the per-process CPU-time clock of another process.)
.TP
.B ESRCH
There is no process with the ID
.IR pid .
.SH VERSIONS
The
.BR clock_getcpuclockid ()
function is available in glibc since version 2.2.

.SH CONFORMING TO
POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008.
.SH NOTES
Calling
.BR clock_gettime (2)
with the clock ID obtained by a call to
.BR clock_getcpuclockid ()
with a
.I pid
of 0,
is the same as using the clock ID
.BR CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID .
.SH EXAMPLE
The example program below obtains the
CPU-time clock ID of the process whose ID is given on the command line,
and then uses
.BR clock_gettime (2)
to obtain the time on that clock.
An example run is the following:
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
.RB "$" " ./a.out 1" "                 # Show CPU clock of init process"
CPU-time clock for PID 1 is 2.213466748 seconds

#define _XOPEN_SOURCE 600
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    clockid_t clockid;
    struct timespec ts;

    if (argc != 2) {
        fprintf(stderr, "%s <process\-ID>\en", argv[0]);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    if (clock_getcpuclockid(atoi(argv[1]), &clockid) != 0) {
        perror("clock_getcpuclockid");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    if (clock_gettime(clockid, &ts) == \-1) {
        perror("clock_gettime");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    printf("CPU-time clock for PID %s is %ld.%09ld seconds\en",
            argv[1], (long) ts.tv_sec, (long) ts.tv_nsec);
    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
