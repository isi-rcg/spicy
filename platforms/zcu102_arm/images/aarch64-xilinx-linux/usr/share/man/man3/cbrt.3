.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions return the (real) cube root of
.IR x .
This function cannot fail; every representable real value has a
representable real cube root.
.SH RETURN VALUE
These functions return the cube root of
.IR x .
.PP
If
.I x
is +0, \-0, positive infinity, negative infinity, or NaN,
.I x
is returned.
