.TH CANONICALIZE_FILE_NAME 3 2017-09-15 "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
canonicalize_file_name \- return the canonicalized absolute pathname
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR "#define _GNU_SOURCE" "         /* See feature_test_macros(7) */"
.br
.B #include <stdlib.h>
.PP
.BI "char *canonicalize_file_name(const char *" path ");"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR canonicalize_file_name ()
function returns a null-terminated string containing
the canonicalized absolute pathname corresponding to
.IR path .
In the returned string, symbolic links are resolved, as are
.I .
and
.I ..
pathname components.
Consecutive slash
.RI ( / )
characters are replaced by a single slash.
.PP
The returned string is dynamically allocated by
.BR canonicalize_file_name ()
and the caller should deallocate it with
.BR free (3)
when it is no longer required.
.PP
The call
.I canonicalize_file_name(path)
is equivalent to the call:
.PP
    realpath(path, NULL);
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success,
.BR canonicalize_file_name ()
returns a null-terminated string.
On error (e.g., a pathname component is unreadable or does not exist),
.BR canonicalize_file_name ()
returns NULL and sets
.I errno
to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
See
.BR realpath (3).
