.SH DESCRIPTION
Calling
.BR pthread_testcancel ()
creates a cancellation point within the calling thread,
so that a thread that is otherwise executing code that contains
no cancellation points will respond to a cancellation request.

If cancelability is disabled (using
.BR pthread_setcancelstate (3)),
or no cancellation request is pending,
then a call to
.BR pthread_testcancel ()
has no effect.
.SH RETURN VALUE
This function does not return a value.
If the calling thread is canceled as a consequence of a call
to this function, then the function does not return.
.SH ERRORS
This function always succeeds.
.\" SH VERSIONS
