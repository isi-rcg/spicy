.TH ISWSPACE 3  2019-03-06 "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
iswspace \- test for whitespace wide character
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <wctype.h>
.PP
.BI "int iswspace(wint_t " wc );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR iswspace ()
function is the wide-character equivalent of the
.BR isspace (3)
function.
It tests whether
.I wc
is a wide character
belonging to the wide-character class "space".
.PP
The wide-character class "space" is disjoint from the wide-character class
"graph" and therefore also disjoint from its subclasses "alnum", "alpha",
"upper", "lower", "digit", "xdigit", "punct".
.\" Note: UNIX98 (susv2/xbd/locale.html) says that "space" and "graph" may
.\" have characters in common, except U+0020. But C99 (ISO/IEC 9899:1999
.\" section 7.25.2.1.10) says that "space" and "graph" are disjoint.
.PP
The wide-character class "space" contains the wide-character class "blank".
.PP
The wide-character class "space" always contains at least the space character
and the control
characters \(aq\ef\(aq, \(aq\en\(aq, \(aq\er\(aq, \(aq\et\(aq, \(aq\ev\(aq.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The
.BR iswspace ()
function returns nonzero if
.I wc
is a wide character
belonging to the wide-character class "space".
Otherwise, it returns zero.
.SH ATTRIBUTES

The behavior of
.BR iswspace ()
depends on the
.B LC_CTYPE
category of the
current locale.
