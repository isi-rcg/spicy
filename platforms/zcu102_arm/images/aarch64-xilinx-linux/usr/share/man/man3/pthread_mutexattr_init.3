.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <pthread.h>
.PP
.BI "int pthread_mutexattr_init(pthread_mutexattr_t *" attr ");"
.BI "int pthread_mutexattr_destroy(pthread_mutexattr_t *" attr ");"

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR pthread_mutexattr_init ()
function initializes the mutex attributes object pointed to by
.I attr
with default values for all attributes defined by the implementation.
.PP
The results of initializing an already initialized mutex attributes
object are undefined.
.PP
The
.BR pthread_mutexattr_destroy ()
function destroys a mutex attribute object (making it uninitialized).
Once a mutex attributes object has been destroyed, it can be reinitialized with
.BR pthread_mutexattr_init ().
.PP
The results of destroying an uninitialized mutex attributes
object are undefined.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, these functions return 0.
On error, they return a positive error number.
