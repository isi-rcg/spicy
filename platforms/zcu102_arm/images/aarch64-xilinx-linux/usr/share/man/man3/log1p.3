.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions return a value equivalent to
.PP
.nf
    log (1 + \fIx\fP)
.fi
.PP
The result is computed in a way
that is accurate even if the value of
.I x
is near zero.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, these functions return the natural logarithm of
.IR "(1\ +\ x)" .
.PP
If
.I x
is a NaN,
a NaN is returned.
.PP
If
.I x
is positive infinity, positive infinity is returned.
.PP
If
.I x
is \-1, a pole error occurs,
and the functions return
.RB - HUGE_VAL ,
.RB - HUGE_VALF ,
or
.RB - HUGE_VALL ,
respectively.
.PP
If
.I x
is less than \-1 (including negative infinity),
a domain error occurs,
and a NaN (not a number) is returned.
.\" POSIX.1 specifies a possible range error if x is subnormal
.\" glibc 2.8 doesn't do this
.SH ERRORS
See
.BR math_error (7)
for information on how to determine whether an error has occurred
when calling these functions.
.PP
The following errors can occur:
.TP
Domain error: \fIx\fP is less than \-1
.I errno
is set to
.BR EDOM
(but see BUGS).
An invalid floating-point exception
.RB ( FE_INVALID )
is raised.
.TP
Pole error: \fIx\fP is \-1
.I errno
is set to
.BR ERANGE
(but see BUGS).
A divide-by-zero floating-point exception
.RB ( FE_DIVBYZERO )
is raised.
