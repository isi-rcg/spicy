.SH CONFORMING TO
POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, 4.3BSD.
.SH NOTES
In glibc up to version 2.1.1, the type of the
.I loc
argument was
.IR off_t .
POSIX.1-2001 specifies
.IR long ,
and this is the type used since glibc 2.1.2.
See
.BR telldir (3)
for information on why you should be careful in making any
assumptions about the value in this argument.
