.TH SLEEP 3  2017-09-15 "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
sleep \- sleep for a specified number of seconds
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <unistd.h>
.PP
.BI "unsigned int sleep(unsigned int " "seconds" );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR sleep ()
causes the calling thread to sleep either until
the number of real-time seconds specified in
.I seconds
have elapsed or until a signal arrives which is not ignored.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Zero if the requested time has elapsed,
or the number of seconds left to sleep,
if the call was interrupted by a signal handler.
.SH ATTRIBUTES
For an explanation of the terms used in this section, see
.BR attributes (7).

.SH CONFORMING TO
POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008.
.SH NOTES
On Linux,
.BR sleep ()
is implemented via
.BR nanosleep (2).
See the
.BR nanosleep (2)
man page for a discussion of the clock used.
.SS Portability notes
On some systems,
.BR sleep ()
may be implemented using
.BR alarm (2)
and
.BR SIGALRM
(POSIX.1 permits this);
mixing calls to
.BR alarm (2)
and
.BR sleep ()
is a bad idea.
.PP
Using
.BR longjmp (3)
from a signal handler or modifying the handling of
.B SIGALRM
while sleeping will cause undefined results.
