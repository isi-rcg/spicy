.TH SYSV_SIGNAL 3 2017-09-15 "" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
sysv_signal \- signal handling with System V semantics
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR "#define _GNU_SOURCE" "         /* See feature_test_macros(7) */"
.br
.B #include <signal.h>
.PP
.B typedef void (*sighandler_t)(int);
.PP
.BI "sighandler_t sysv_signal(int " signum ", sighandler_t " handler );
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR sysv_signal ()
function takes the same arguments, and performs the same task, as
.BR signal (2).
.PP
However
.BR sysv_signal ()
provides the System V unreliable signal semantics, that is:
a) the disposition of the signal is reset to the default
when the handler is invoked;
b) delivery of further instances of the signal is not blocked while
the signal handler is executing; and
c) if the handler interrupts (certain) blocking system calls,
then the system call is not automatically restarted.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The
.BR sysv_signal ()
function returns the previous value of the signal handler, or
.B SIG_ERR
on error.
.SH ERRORS
As for
.BR signal (2).
.SH ATTRIBUTES
For an explanation of the terms used in this section, see
.BR attributes (7).

.SH CONFORMING TO
This function is nonstandard.
.SH NOTES
Use of
.BR sysv_signal ()
should be avoided; use
.BR sigaction (2)
instead.
.PP
On older Linux systems,
.BR sysv_signal ()
and
.BR signal (2)
were equivalent.
But on newer systems,
.BR signal (2)
provides reliable signal semantics; see
.BR signal (2)
for details.
.PP
The use of
.I sighandler_t
is a GNU extension;
this type is defined only if
the
.B _GNU_SOURCE
feature test macro is defined.
