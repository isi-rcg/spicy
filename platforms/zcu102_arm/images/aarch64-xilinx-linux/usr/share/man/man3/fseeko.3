.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR fseeko ()
and
.BR ftello ()
functions are identical to
.BR fseek (3)
and
.BR ftell (3)
(see
.BR fseek (3)),
respectively, except that the
.I offset
argument of
.BR fseeko ()
and the return value of
.BR ftello ()
is of type
.I off_t
instead of
.IR long .
.PP
On some architectures, both
.IR off_t
and
.I long
are 32-bit types, but defining
.BR _FILE_OFFSET_BITS
with the value 64 (before including
.I any
header files)
will turn
.I off_t
into a 64-bit type.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On successful completion,
.BR fseeko ()
returns 0, while
.BR ftello ()
returns the current offset.
Otherwise, \-1 is returned and
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
See the ERRORS in
.BR fseek (3).
.SH VERSIONS
These functions are available under glibc since version 2.1.
