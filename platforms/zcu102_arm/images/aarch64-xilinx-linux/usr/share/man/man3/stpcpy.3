.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR stpcpy ()
function copies the string pointed to by
.I src
(including the terminating null byte (\(aq\e0\(aq)) to the array pointed to by
.IR dest .
The strings may not overlap, and the destination string
.I dest
must be large enough to receive the copy.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.BR stpcpy ()
returns a pointer to the
.B end
of the string
.I dest
(that is, the address of the terminating null byte)
rather than the beginning.

.SH CONFORMING TO
This function was added to POSIX.1-2008.
Before that, it was not part of
the C or POSIX.1 standards, nor customary on UNIX systems.
It first appeared at least as early as 1986,
in the Lattice C AmigaDOS compiler,
then in the GNU fileutils and GNU textutils in 1989,
and in the GNU C library by 1992.
It is also present on the BSDs.
.SH BUGS
This function may overrun the buffer
.IR dest .
.SH EXAMPLE
For example, this program uses
.BR stpcpy ()
to concatenate
.B foo
and
.B bar
to produce
.BR foobar ,
which it then prints.
.PP

#define _GNU_SOURCE

main(void)
{
    char buffer[20];
    char *to = buffer;

    to = stpcpy(to, "foo");
    to = stpcpy(to, "bar");
    printf("%s\en", buffer);
