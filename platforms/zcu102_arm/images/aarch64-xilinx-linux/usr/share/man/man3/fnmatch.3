.TH FNMATCH 3  2019-03-06 "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
fnmatch \- match filename or pathname
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <fnmatch.h>
.PP
.BI "int fnmatch(const char *" "pattern" ", const char *" string ", int " flags );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR fnmatch ()
function checks whether the
.I string
argument matches the
.I pattern
argument, which is a shell wildcard pattern (see
.BR glob (7)).
.PP
The
.I flags
argument modifies the behavior; it is the bitwise OR of zero or more
of the following flags:
.TP
.B FNM_NOESCAPE
If this flag is set, treat backslash as an ordinary character,
instead of an escape character.
.TP
.B FNM_PATHNAME
If this flag is set, match a slash in
.I string
only with a slash in
.I pattern
and not by an asterisk (*) or a question mark (?) metacharacter,
nor by a bracket expression ([]) containing a slash.
.TP
.B FNM_PERIOD
If this flag is set, a leading period in
.I string
has to be matched exactly by a period in
.IR pattern .
A period is considered to be leading if it is the first character in
.IR string ,
or if both
.B FNM_PATHNAME
is set and the period immediately follows a slash.
.TP
.B FNM_FILE_NAME
This is a GNU synonym for
.BR FNM_PATHNAME .
.TP
.B FNM_LEADING_DIR
If this flag (a GNU extension) is set, the pattern is considered to be
matched if it matches an initial segment of
.I string
which is followed by a slash.
This flag is mainly for the internal
use of glibc and is implemented only in certain cases.
.TP
.B FNM_CASEFOLD
If this flag (a GNU extension) is set, the pattern is matched
case-insensitively.
.TP
.B FNM_EXTMATCH
If this flag (a GNU extension) is set, extended patterns are
supported, as introduced by \&'ksh' and now supported by other shells.
The extended format is as follows, with \fIpattern\-list\fR
being a \&'|' separated list of patterns.
.TP
\&'?(\fIpattern\-list\fR)'
The pattern matches if zero or one occurrences of any of the
patterns in the \fIpattern\-list\fR match the input \fIstring\fR.
.TP
\&'*(\fIpattern\-list\fR)'
The pattern matches if zero or more occurrences of any of the
patterns in the \fIpattern\-list\fR match the input \fIstring\fR.
.TP
\&'+(\fIpattern\-list\fR)'
The pattern matches if one or more occurrences of any of the
patterns in the \fIpattern\-list\fR match the input \fIstring\fR.
.TP
\&'@(\fIpattern\-list\fR)'
The pattern matches if exactly one occurrence of any of the
patterns in the \fIpattern\-list\fR match the input \fIstring\fR.
.TP
\&'!(\fIpattern\-list\fR)'
The pattern matches if the input \fIstring\fR cannot be matched with
any of the patterns in the \fIpattern\-list\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Zero if
.I string
matches
.IR pattern ,
.B FNM_NOMATCH
if there is no match or another nonzero value if there is an error.
