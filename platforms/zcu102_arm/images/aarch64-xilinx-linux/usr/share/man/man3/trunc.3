.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions round
.I x
to the nearest integer value that is not larger in magnitude than
.IR x .
.SH RETURN VALUE
These functions return the rounded integer value, in floating format.
.PP
If
.I x
is integral, infinite, or NaN,
.I x
itself is returned.
.SH ERRORS
No errors occur.
.SH VERSIONS
These functions first appeared in glibc in version 2.1.

.SH CONFORMING TO
C99, POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008.
.SH NOTES
The integral value returned by these functions may be too large
to store in an integer type
.RI ( int ,
.IR long ,
etc.).
To avoid an overflow, which will produce undefined results,
an application should perform a range check on the returned value
before assigning it to an integer type.
