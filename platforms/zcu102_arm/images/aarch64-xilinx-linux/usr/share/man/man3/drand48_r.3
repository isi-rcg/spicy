.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions are the reentrant analogs of the functions described in
.BR drand48 (3).
Instead of modifying the global random generator state, they use
the supplied data
.IR buffer .
.PP
Before the first use, this struct must be initialized, for example,
by filling it with zeros, or by calling one of the functions
.BR srand48_r (),
.BR seed48_r (),
or
.BR lcong48_r ().
.SH RETURN VALUE
The return value is 0.
.SH ATTRIBUTES
