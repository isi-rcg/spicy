.SH NAME
cfree \- free allocated memory
.SH SYNOPSIS

.B "#include <stdlib.h>"
.PP
/* In SunOS 4 */
.BI "int cfree(void *" ptr );
.PP
/* In glibc or FreeBSD libcompat */
.BI "void cfree(void *" ptr );
.PP
/* In SCO OpenServer */

Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
.BR feature_test_macros (7)):

.PP
.BR cfree ():
    Since glibc 2.19:
        _DEFAULT_SOURCE
    Glibc 2.19 and earlier:
        _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function should never be used.
Use
.BR free (3)
instead.
Starting with version 2.26, it has been removed from glibc.
.SS 1-arg cfree
In glibc, the function
.BR cfree ()
is a synonym for
.BR free (3),
"added for compatibility with SunOS".
.PP
Other systems have other functions with this name.
The declaration is sometimes in
.I <stdlib.h>
and sometimes in
.IR <malloc.h> .
.SS 3-arg cfree
Some SCO and Solaris versions have malloc libraries with a 3-argument
.BR cfree (),
apparently as an analog to
.BR calloc (3).
.PP
If you need it while porting something, add
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
#define cfree(p, n, s) free((p))
.EE
.in
.PP
to your file.
.PP
A frequently asked question is "Can I use
.BR free (3)
to free memory allocated with
.BR calloc (3),
or do I need
.BR cfree ()?"
Answer: use
.BR free (3).
.PP
An SCO manual writes: "The cfree routine is provided for compliance
to the iBCSe2 standard and simply calls free.
The num and size
arguments to cfree are not used."
.SH RETURN VALUE
The SunOS version of
.BR cfree ()
(which is a synonym for
.BR free (3))
returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.
In case of error,
.I errno
is set to
.BR EINVAL :
the value of
.I ptr
was not a pointer to a block previously allocated by
one of the routines in the
.BR malloc (3)
family.
.SH VERSIONS
The
.BR cfree ()
function was removed
.\" commit 025b33ae84bb8f15b2748a1d8605dca453fce112
from glibc in version 2.26.
