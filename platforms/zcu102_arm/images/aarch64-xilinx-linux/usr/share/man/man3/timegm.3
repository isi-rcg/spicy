.BR timelocal (),

    Since glibc 2.19:
        _DEFAULT_SOURCE
    Glibc 2.19 and earlier:
        _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functions
.BR timelocal ()
and
.BR timegm ()
are the inverses of
.BR localtime (3)
and
.BR gmtime (3).
Both functions take a broken-down time and convert it to calendar time
(seconds since the Epoch, 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000, UTC).
The difference between the two functions is that
.BR timelocal ()
takes the local timezone into account when doing the conversion, while
.BR timegm ()
takes the input value to be Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success,
these functions return the calendar time (seconds since the Epoch),
expressed as a value of type
.IR time_t .
On error, they return the value
.I (time_t)\ \-1
and set
.I errno
to indicate the cause of the error.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EOVERFLOW
The result cannot be represented.

.SH CONFORMING TO
These functions are nonstandard GNU extensions
that are also present on the BSDs.
Avoid their use.
.SH NOTES
The
.BR timelocal ()
function is equivalent to the POSIX standard function
.BR mktime (3).
There is no reason to ever use it.
