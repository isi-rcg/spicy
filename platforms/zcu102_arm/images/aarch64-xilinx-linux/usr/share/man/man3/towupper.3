.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR towupper ()
function is the wide-character equivalent of the
.BR toupper (3)
function.
If
.I wc
is a lowercase wide character,
and there exists an uppercase equivalent in the current locale,
it returns the uppercase equivalent of
.IR wc .
In all other cases,
.I wc
is returned unchanged.
.PP
The
.BR towupper_l ()
function performs the same task,
but performs the conversion based on the character type information in
the locale specified by
.IR locale .
The behavior of
.BR towupper_l ()
is undefined if
.I locale
is the special locale object
.B LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE
(see
.BR duplocale (3))
or is not a valid locale object handle.
.PP
The argument
.I wc
must be representable as a
.I wchar_t
and be a valid character in the locale or be the value
.BR WEOF .
.SH RETURN VALUE
If
.I wc
was convertible to uppercase,
.BR towupper ()
returns its uppercase equivalent;
otherwise it returns
.IR wc .
.SH VERSIONS
The
.BR towupper_l ()
function first appeared in glibc 2.3.

.SH CONFORMING TO
.BR towupper ():
C99, POSIX.1-2001 (XSI);
present as an XSI extension in POSIX.1-2008, but marked obsolete.
.PP
.BR towupper_l ():
POSIX.1-2008.
.SH NOTES
The behavior of these functions depends on the
.B LC_CTYPE
category of the locale.
.PP
These functions are not very appropriate for dealing with Unicode characters,
because Unicode knows about three cases: upper, lower and title case.
