.SH NAME
strcmp, strncmp \- compare two strings
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <string.h>
.PP
.BI "int strcmp(const char *" s1 ", const char *" s2 );
.PP
.BI "int strncmp(const char *" s1 ", const char *" s2 ", size_t " n );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR strcmp ()
function compares the two strings
.I s1
and
.IR s2 .
The locale is not taken into account (for a locale-aware comparison, see
.BR strcoll (3)).
It returns an integer less than, equal to, or greater
than zero if
.I s1
is found, respectively, to be less than,
to match, or be greater than
.IR s2 .
.PP
The
.BR strncmp ()
function is similar, except it compares
only the first (at most)
.IR n
bytes of
.I s1
and
.IR s2 .
.SH RETURN VALUE
The
.BR strcmp ()
and
.BR strncmp ()
functions return an integer
less than, equal to, or greater than zero if
.I s1
(or the first
.I n
bytes thereof) is found, respectively, to be less than, to
match, or be greater than
.IR s2 .
