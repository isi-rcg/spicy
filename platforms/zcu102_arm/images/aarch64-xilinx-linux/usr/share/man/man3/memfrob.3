.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR memfrob ()
function encrypts the first \fIn\fP bytes of the
memory area \fIs\fP by exclusive-ORing each character with the number
42.
The effect can be reversed by using
.BR memfrob ()
on the
encrypted memory area.

Note that this function is not a proper encryption routine as the XOR
constant is fixed, and is suitable only for hiding strings.

The
.BR memfrob ()
function returns a pointer to the encrypted memory
area.
