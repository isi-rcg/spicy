.SH NAME
wcsncpy \- copy a fixed-size string of wide characters
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <wchar.h>
.PP
.BI "wchar_t *wcsncpy(wchar_t *" dest ", const wchar_t *" src ", size_t " n );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR wcsncpy ()
function is the wide-character equivalent of the
.BR strncpy (3)
function.
It copies at most
.I n
wide characters from the wide-character
string pointed to by
.IR src ,
including the terminating null wide character (L\(aq\e0\(aq),
to the array pointed to by
.IR dest .
Exactly
.I n
wide characters are
written at
.IR dest .
If the length \fIwcslen(src)\fP is smaller than
.IR n ,
the remaining wide characters in the array
pointed to by
.I dest
are filled
with null wide characters.
If the length \fIwcslen(src)\fP is greater than or equal
to
.IR n ,
the string pointed to by
.I dest
will not be terminated by a null wide character.
.PP
The strings may not overlap.
.PP
The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least
.I n
wide
characters at
.IR dest .
.SH RETURN VALUE
.BR wcsncpy ()
returns
.IR dest .
