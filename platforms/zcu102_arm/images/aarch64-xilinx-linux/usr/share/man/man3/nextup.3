.SH NAME

return next floating-point number toward positive/negative infinity
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR nextup (),
.BR nextupf (),
and
.BR nextupl ()
functions return the next representable floating-point number greater than
.IR x .
.PP
If
.I x
is the smallest representable negative number in the corresponding type,
these functions return \-0.
If
.I x
is 0, the returned value is the smallest representable positive number
of the corresponding type.
.PP
If
.I x
is positive infinity, the returned value is positive infinity.
If
.I x
is negative infinity,
the returned value is the largest representable finite negative number
of the corresponding type.
.PP
If
.I x
is Nan,
the returned value is NaN.
.PP
The value returned by
.IR nextdown(x)
is
.IR \-nextup(\-x) ,
and similarly for the other types.
.SH RETURN VALUE
See DESCRIPTION.

.SH VERSIONS
These functions first appeared in glibc in version 2.24.
