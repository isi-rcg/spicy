.SH NAME
iswalpha \- test for alphabetic wide character
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <wctype.h>
.PP
.BI "int iswalpha(wint_t " wc );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR iswalpha ()
function is the wide-character equivalent of the
.BR isalpha (3)
function.
It tests whether
.I wc
is a wide character
belonging to the wide-character class "alpha".
.PP
The wide-character class "alpha" is a subclass of the
wide-character class "alnum",
and therefore also a subclass of the wide-character class "graph" and
of the wide-character class "print".
.PP
Being a subclass of the wide-character class "print",
the wide-character class
"alpha" is disjoint from the wide-character class "cntrl".
.PP
Being a subclass of the wide-character class "graph",
the wide-character class "alpha" is disjoint from
the wide-character class "space" and its subclass "blank".
.PP
Being a subclass of the wide-character class "alnum",
the wide-character class "alpha" is disjoint from the
wide-character class "punct".
.PP
The wide-character class "alpha" is disjoint from the wide-character class
"digit".
.PP
The wide-character class "alpha" contains the wide-character classes "upper"
and "lower".
.PP
The wide-character class "alpha" always contains at least the
letters \(aqA\(aq to \(aqZ\(aq and \(aqa\(aq to \(aqz\(aq.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The
.BR iswalpha ()
function returns nonzero
if
.I wc
is a wide character
belonging to the wide-character class "alpha".
Otherwise, it returns zero.

category of the
current locale.
