.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions compute the floating-point remainder of dividing
.I x
by
.IR y .
The return value is
.IR x
\-
.I n
*
.IR y ,
where
.I n
is the quotient of
.I x
/
.IR y ,
rounded toward zero to an integer.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, these
functions return the value \fIx\fP\ \-\ \fIn\fP*\fIy\fP,
for some integer
.IR n ,
such that the returned value has the same sign as
.I x
and a magnitude less than the magnitude of
.IR y .
.PP
If
.I x
or
.I y
is a NaN, a NaN is returned.
.PP
If
.I x
is an infinity,
a domain error occurs, and
a NaN is returned.
.PP
If
.I y
is zero,
a domain error occurs, and
a NaN is returned.
.PP
If
.I x
is +0 (\-0), and
.I y
is not zero, +0 (\-0) is returned.
.SH ERRORS
See
.BR math_error (7)
for information on how to determine whether an error has occurred
when calling these functions.
.PP
The following errors can occur:
.TP
Domain error: \fIx\fP is an infinity
.I errno
is set to
.BR EDOM
(but see BUGS).
An invalid floating-point exception
.RB ( FE_INVALID )
is raised.
.TP
Domain error: \fIy\fP is zero
.I errno
is set to
.BR EDOM .
An invalid floating-point exception
.RB ( FE_INVALID )
is raised.
.\" POSIX.1 documents an optional underflow error, but AFAICT it doesn't
.\" (can't?) occur -- mtk, Jul 2008

.SH CONFORMING TO
C99, POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008.
.PP
The variant returning
.I double
also conforms to
SVr4, 4.3BSD, C89.
.SH BUGS
Before version 2.10, the glibc implementation did not set
.\" http://sources.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6784
.I errno
to
.B EDOM
when a domain error occurred for an infinite
.IR x .
