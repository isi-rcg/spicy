.SH NAME
difftime \- calculate time difference
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <time.h>
.PP
.BI "double difftime(time_t " time1 ", time_t " time0 );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR difftime ()
function returns the number of seconds elapsed
between time \fItime1\fP and time \fItime0\fP, represented as a
.IR double .
Each of the times is specified in calendar time, which means its
value is a measurement (in seconds) relative to the
Epoch, 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC).
.SH ATTRIBUTES
For an explanation of the terms used in this section, see

.SH NOTES
On a POSIX system,
.I time_t
is an arithmetic type, and one could just
define
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
#define difftime(t1,t0) (double)(t1 \- t0)
.EE
.in
.PP
when the possible overflow in the subtraction is not a concern.
