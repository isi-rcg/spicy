.SH NAME
_llseek \- reposition read/write file offset
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <sys/types.h>
.B #include <unistd.h>
.PP
.BI "int _llseek(unsigned int " fd ", unsigned long " offset_high ,
.BI "            unsigned long " offset_low ", loff_t *" result ,
.BI "            unsigned int " whence );
.fi
.PP
.IR Note :
There is no glibc wrapper for this system call; see NOTES.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR _llseek ()
system call repositions the offset of the open file description associated
with the file descriptor
.I fd
to
.I (offset_high<<32) | offset_low
bytes relative to the beginning of the file, the current file offset,
or the end of the file, depending on whether
.I whence
is
.BR SEEK_SET ,
.BR SEEK_CUR ,
or
.BR SEEK_END ,
respectively.
It returns the resulting file position in the argument
.IR result .
.PP
This system call exists on various 32-bit platforms to support
seeking to large file offsets.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful completion,
.BR _llseek ()
returns 0.
Otherwise, a value of \-1 is returned and
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EBADF
.I fd
is not an open file descriptor.
.TP
.B EFAULT
Problem with copying results to user space.
.TP
.B EINVAL
.I whence
is invalid.
.SH CONFORMING TO
This function is Linux-specific, and should not be used in programs
intended to be portable.
.SH NOTES
Glibc does not provide a wrapper for this system call.
To invoke it directly, use
.BR syscall (2).
However, you probably want to use the
.BR lseek (2)
wrapper function instead.
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR lseek (2),
.BR open (2),
.BR lseek64 (3)
