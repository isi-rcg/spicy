.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions are nonstandard; in new programs, the use of
.BR waitpid (2)
or
.BR waitid (2)
is preferable.
.PP
The
.BR wait3 ()
and
.BR wait4 ()
system calls are similar to
.BR waitpid (2),
but additionally return resource usage information about the
child in the structure pointed to by
.IR rusage .
.PP
Other than the use of the
.I rusage
argument, the following
.BR wait3 ()
call:
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
wait3(wstatus, options, rusage);
.EE
.in
.PP
is equivalent to:
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
waitpid(\-1, wstatus, options);
.EE
.in
.PP
Similarly, the following
.BR wait4 ()
call:
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
wait4(pid, wstatus, options, rusage);
.EE
.in
.PP
is equivalent to:
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
waitpid(pid, wstatus, options);
.EE
.in
.PP
In other words,
.BR wait3 ()
waits of any child, while
.BR wait4 ()
can be used to select a specific child, or children, on which to wait.
See
.BR wait (2)
for further details.
.PP
If
.I rusage
is not NULL, the
.I struct rusage
to which it points will be filled with accounting information
about the child.
See
.BR getrusage (2)
for details.
.SH RETURN VALUE
As for
.BR waitpid (2).
.SH ERRORS
As for
.BR waitpid (2).
.SH CONFORMING TO
4.3BSD.
.PP
SUSv1 included a specification of
.BR wait3 ();
SUSv2 included
.BR wait3 (),
but marked it LEGACY;
SUSv3 removed it.
.SH NOTES
Including
.I <sys/time.h>
is not required these days, but increases portability.
(Indeed,
.I <sys/resource.h>
defines the
.I rusage
structure with fields of type
.I struct timeval
defined in
.IR <sys/time.h> .)
.SS C library/kernel differences
On Linux,
.BR wait3 ()
is a library function implemented on top of the
.BR wait4 ()
system call.
