.SH NAME
hier \- description of the filesystem hierarchy
.SH DESCRIPTION
A typical Linux system has, among others, the following directories:
.TP
.I /
This is the root directory.
This is where the whole tree starts.
.TP
.I /bin
This directory contains executable programs which are needed in
single user mode and to bring the system up or repair it.
.TP
.I /boot
Contains static files for the boot loader.
This directory holds only
the files which are needed during the boot process.
The map installer
and configuration files should go to
.I /sbin
and
.IR /etc .
The operating system kernel (initrd for example) must be located in either
.I /
or
.IR /boot .
.TP
.I /dev
Special or device files, which refer to physical devices.
See
.BR mknod (1).
.TP
.I /etc
Contains configuration files which are local to the machine.
Some
larger software packages, like X11, can have their own subdirectories
below
.IR /etc .
Site-wide configuration files may be placed here or in
.IR /usr/etc .
Nevertheless, programs should always look for these files in
.I /etc
and you may have links for these files to
.IR /usr/etc .
.TP
.I /etc/opt
Host-specific configuration files for add-on applications installed
in
.IR /opt .
.TP
.I /etc/sgml
This directory contains the configuration files for SGML (optional).
.TP
.I /etc/skel
When a new user account is created, files from this directory are
usually copied into the user's home directory.
.TP
.I /etc/X11
Configuration files for the X11 window system (optional).
.TP
.I /etc/xml
This directory contains the configuration files for XML (optional).
.TP
.I /home
On machines with home directories for users, these are usually beneath
this directory, directly or not.
The structure of this directory
depends on local administration decisions (optional).
.TP
.I /lib
This directory should hold those shared libraries that are necessary
to boot the system and to run the commands in the root filesystem.
.TP
.I /lib<qual>
These directories are variants of
.I /lib
on system which support more than one binary format requiring separate
libraries (optional).
.TP
.I /lib/modules
Loadable kernel modules (optional).
.TP
.I /lost+found
This directory contains items lost in the filesystem.
These items are usually chunks of files mangled as a consequence of
a faulty disk or a system crash.
.TP
.I /media
This directory contains mount points for removable media such as CD
and DVD disks or USB sticks.
On systems where more than one device exists
for mounting a certain type of media,
mount directories can be created by appending a digit
to the name of those available above starting with '0',
but the unqualified name must also exist.
.TP
.I /media/floppy[1\-9]
Floppy drive (optional).
.TP
.I /media/cdrom[1\-9]
CD-ROM drive (optional).
.TP
.I /media/cdrecorder[1\-9]
CD writer (optional).
.TP
.I /media/zip[1\-9]
Zip drive (optional).
.TP
.I /media/usb[1\-9]
USB drive (optional).
.TP
.I /mnt
This directory is a mount point for a temporarily mounted filesystem.
In some distributions,
.I /mnt
contains subdirectories intended to be used as mount points for several
temporary filesystems.
.TP
.I /opt
This directory should contain add-on packages that contain static files.
.TP
.I /proc
This is a mount point for the
.I proc
filesystem, which provides information about running processes and
the kernel.
This pseudo-filesystem is described in more detail in
.BR proc (5).
.TP
.I /root
This directory is usually the home directory for the root user (optional).
.TP
.I /sbin
Like
.IR /bin ,
this directory holds commands needed to boot the system, but which are
usually not executed by normal users.
.TP
.I /srv
This directory contains site-specific data that is served by this system.
.TP
.I /sys
This is a mount point for the sysfs filesystem, which provides information
about the kernel like
.IR /proc ,
but better structured, following the formalism of kobject infrastructure.
.TP
.I /tmp
This directory contains temporary files which may be deleted with no
notice, such as by a regular job or at system boot up.
.TP
.I /usr
This directory is usually mounted from a separate partition.
It should hold only shareable, read-only data, so that it can be mounted
by various machines running Linux.
.TP
.I /usr/X11R6
The X\-Window system, version 11 release 6 (optional).
.TP
.I /usr/X11R6/bin
Binaries which belong to the X\-Window system; often, there is a
symbolic link from the more traditional
.I /usr/bin/X11
to here.
.TP
.I /usr/X11R6/lib
Data files associated with the X\-Window system.
.TP
.I /usr/X11R6/lib/X11
These contain miscellaneous files needed to run X;  Often, there is a
symbolic link from
.I /usr/lib/X11
to this directory.
.TP
.I /usr/X11R6/include/X11
Contains include files needed for compiling programs using the X11
window system.
Often, there is a symbolic link from
.I /usr/include/X11
to this directory.
.TP
.I /usr/bin
This is the primary directory for executable programs.
Most programs
executed by normal users which are not needed for booting or for
repairing the system and which are not installed locally should be
placed in this directory.
.TP
.I /usr/bin/mh
Commands for the MH mail handling system (optional).
.TP
.I /usr/bin/X11
is the traditional place to look for X11 executables; on Linux, it
usually is a symbolic link to
.IR /usr/X11R6/bin .
.TP
.I /usr/dict
Replaced by
.IR /usr/share/dict .
.TP
.I /usr/doc
Replaced by
.IR /usr/share/doc .
.TP
.I /usr/etc
Site-wide configuration files to be shared between several machines
may be stored in this directory.
However, commands should always
reference those files using the
.I /etc
directory.
Links from files in
.I /etc
should point to the appropriate files in
.IR /usr/etc .
.TP
.I /usr/games
Binaries for games and educational programs (optional).
.TP
.I /usr/include
Include files for the C compiler.
.TP
.I /usr/include/bsd
BSD compatibility include files (optional).
.TP
.I /usr/include/X11
Include files for the C compiler and the X\-Window system.
This is
usually a symbolic link to
.IR /usr/X11R6/include/X11 .
.TP
.I /usr/include/asm
Include files which declare some assembler functions.
This used to be a
symbolic link to
.IR /usr/src/linux/include/asm .
.TP
.I /usr/include/linux
This contains information which may change from system release to
system release and used to be a symbolic link to
.I /usr/src/linux/include/linux
to get at operating-system-specific information.
.IP
(Note that one should have include files there that work correctly with
the current libc and in user space.
However, Linux kernel source is not
designed to be used with user programs and does not know anything
about the libc you are using.
It is very likely that things will break
if you let
.I /usr/include/asm
and
.I /usr/include/linux
point at a random kernel tree.
Debian systems don't do this
and use headers from a known good kernel
version, provided in the libc*-dev package.)
.TP
.I /usr/include/g++
Include files to use with the GNU C++ compiler.
.TP
.I /usr/lib
Object libraries, including dynamic libraries, plus some executables
which usually are not invoked directly.
More complicated programs may
have whole subdirectories there.
.TP
.I /usr/lib<qual>
These directories are variants of
.I /usr/lib
on system which support more than one binary format requiring separate
libraries, except that the symbolic link
.I /usr/lib<qual>/X11
is not required (optional).
.TP
.I /usr/lib/X11
The usual place for data files associated with X programs, and
configuration files for the X system itself.
On Linux, it usually is
a symbolic link to
.IR /usr/X11R6/lib/X11 .

.BR gcc (1).
