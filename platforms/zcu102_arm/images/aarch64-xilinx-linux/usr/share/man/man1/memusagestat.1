.SH NAME
memusagestat \- generate graphic from memory profiling data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR memusagestat " [\fIoption\fR]... \fIdatafile\fR [\fIoutfile\fR]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B memusagestat
creates a PNG file containing a graphical representation of the
memory profiling data in the file
.IR datafile ;
that file is generated via the
.I -d
(or
.IR --data )
option of
.BR memusage (1).
.PP
The red line in the graph shows the heap usage (allocated memory)
and the green line shows the stack usage.
The x-scale is either the number of memory-handling function calls or
(if the
.I -t
option is specified)
time.
