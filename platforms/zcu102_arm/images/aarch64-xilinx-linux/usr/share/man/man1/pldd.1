.SH NAME
pldd \- display dynamic shared objects linked into a process
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.BI "pldd " "pid"
.BI pldd " option"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B pldd
command displays a list of the dynamic shared objects that are
linked into the process with the specified process ID.
The list includes the libraries that have been dynamically loaded using
.BR dlopen (3).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-? ", " \-\-help
Display program help message.
.TP
.B \-\-usage
Display a short usage message.
.TP
.BR \-V ", " \-\-version
Display the program version.
.SH EXIT STATUS
On success,
.B pldd
exits with the status 0.
If the specified process does not exist,
the user does not have permission to access
its dynamic shared object list,
or no command-line arguments are supplied,
.B pldd
exists with a status of 1.
If given an invalid option, it exits with the status 64.
.SH VERSIONS
.B pldd
is available since glibc 2.15.
.SH CONFORMING TO
The
.B pldd
command is not specified by POSIX.1.
Some other systems
.\" There are man pages on Solaris and HP-UX.
have a similar command.
.SH NOTES
The command
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
lsof \-p PID
.EE
.in
.PP
also shows output that includes the dynamic shared objects
that are linked into a process.
.PP
The
.BR gdb (1)
.I "info shared"
command also shows the shared libraries being used by a process,
so that one can obtain similar output to
.B pldd
using a command such as the following
(to monitor the process with the specified
.IR pid ):
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
$ \fBgdb \-ex "set confirm off" \-ex "set height 0" \-ex "info shared" \e\fP
        \fB-ex "quit" \-p $pid | grep '^0x.*0x'\fP
.EE
.in
.SH BUGS
Since glibc 2.19,
.B pldd
is broken: it just hangs when executed.
.\" FIXME . https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=18035
It is unclear if it will ever be fixed.
.SH EXAMPLE

$ \fBpldd $$\fP               # Display DSOs linked into the shell
