LSB version query program (lsb_release) by Dominique Massonie
(mdomi@users.sourceforge.net)

This program forms part of the required functionality of the LSB
(Linux Standard Base) specification.

The program queries the installed state of the distribution to display
certain properties such as the version of the LSB against which the
distribution claims compliance as well. It can also attempt to display
the name and release of the distribution along with an identifier of
who produces the distribution.
