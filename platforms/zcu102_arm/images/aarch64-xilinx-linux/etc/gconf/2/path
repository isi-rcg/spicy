# This file stores the addresses of config sources for GConf
# When a value is stored or requested, the sources are scanned from top to 
# bottom, and the first one to have a value for the key (or the first one 
# to be writeable) is used to load/store the data.

# See the GConf manual for details

# Look first in systemwide mandatory settings directory

# To read in any mandatory settings that the Sys Admin may have created
# prior to a desktop system upgrade. The SysAdmin can stick read-only system
# wide sources in this file.

# Now see where users want us to look - basically the user can stick arbitrary 
# sources in a ~/.config/gconf.path file and they're inserted here
